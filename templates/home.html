      Hi! My name is Antoni and this is my frutiger aero styled website. I'm a
      Modern Technologies in Forensic Science student. I'm interested in
      GNU/Linux and cybersecurity. I also like being tedious how old internet
      was the best: no AI slop, no paywalls, no ad-trackers on every corner;
      just find what you need and enjoy yourself in peace. I like learning new
      languages (real life languages), that's why you may find some
      japanese/russian accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, I used to work on both frontend (React.js) and backend
      (Python, tRPC, PostgreSQL), but I have to admit that tinkering with
      systems and analyzing logs sounds much more fun. Google wouldn't be Google
      without stable, safe servers and setting them up? That's the good stuff.

      This is not a blog nor my portfolio (or maybe it is, idk). The purpose of
      this website is pretty simple: I love 2000s technology. Switching from
      modern devices packed with AI and other data stealing tools to my good,
      old blackberry is a great way to rest and slow down. Unfortunately you
      can't do a lot, as many modern websites or applications are not compatible
      with old school technology.
    </p>

      That's why I wanted to create a space, where I could store and create
      stuff that might come in handy and is available on everything I use. Of
      course it may look inelegant and be a little sluggish, but nothing beats
      good old HTML + CSS. No javascript nor modern UI libraries, just some ugly
      but reliable, spaghetti style.css &lt;3
